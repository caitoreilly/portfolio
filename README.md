The goal of this project was to create a framework for a professional portfolio. This portfolio houses information about me, about my projects, and various ways to contact me. Click to access my portfolio project webpage [here](https://caitoreilly.github.io/portfolio/).

## Description

---

This project demonstrates the use of HTML and CSS to structure a web page with a header, nav bar with links to sections on the site, URLs linked to projects images, and URLs and emails linked to ways to contact me. CSS was also used to add colors, fonts, backgrounds, hovers, and a hero image. I linked the GitHub URL to my finalized Run Buddy project and included place holder "Coming Soon" images for other projects to come. I also worked on media queries for the webpage to adapt to various screen sizes.
